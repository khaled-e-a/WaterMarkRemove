Configuration.storekit
# We might want to track Configuration.storekit if it's shared, but user asked for "suitable".
# Usually storekit configs are committed for testing. I will UNIGNORE it.
# !Configuration.storekit (implied by not listing it, unless we want to ignore user specific changes?)
# Keeping it tracked is better for this project since it defines the products.

# Generated files (if any specific ones we want to ignore)
